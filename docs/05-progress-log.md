# Progress Log

## Current Version
### Implementations
- Base project structure with Serverless Framework
- Event scheduling and processing system
- Team creation workflow
- Event logging system
- Complete project documentation

### Next Steps
- Implement event retry mechanism
- Add automated tests
- Improve event monitoring
- Implement event validation
- Add event documentation

## Technical Decision History
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Decision: Use AWS EventBridge for scheduling
   - Reason: Reliable event scheduling and processing
   - Date: [Decision date]

2. **Serverless Architecture**
   - Decision: Use AWS Lambda with Serverless Framework
   - Reason: Automatic scalability and cost-effectiveness
   - Date: [Decision date]

3. **Folder Structure**
   - Decision: Organize into domain, infrastructure, and utils
   - Reason: Clear separation of responsibilities
   - Date: [Decision date]

## Pending Improvements
### High Priority
- [ ] Implement event retry mechanism
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests
- [ ] Implement event validation
- [ ] Improve error logging
- [ ] Add performance metrics

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Optimize MongoDB queries
- [ ] Implement event batching
- [ ] Add event documentation

## Known Issues
1. **Event Processing Reliability**
   - Description: Events may fail during processing
   - Impact: High
   - Proposed Solution: Implement retry mechanism

2. **Lack of Automated Tests**
   - Description: Insufficient test coverage
   - Impact: Medium
   - Proposed Solution: Implement test suite
